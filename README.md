# refactoring
A look at the code of data interpreter for the purpose of refactoring according to bad smells. https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring

Scenario contains the original code
Refactoring folders contain key removal of bad smells
I have placed instructions in the root folder of what the removal will look like for smells

RefactoringVersion1 is looking at the Large Class smells
RefactoringVerssion2 is looking at the Long Method smell
RefactoringVersion3 is looking at the Inappropriate Intimacy smell. I have included the test coverage in that file

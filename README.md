# refactoring
A look at the code of data interpreter for the purpose of refactoring according to bad smells. https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring

Scenario contains the original code
Refactoring folders contain key removal of bad smells
I have placed instructions in the root folder of what the removal will look like for smells

RefactoringVersion1 is looking at the Large Class smells
RefactoringVerssion2 is looking at the Long Method smell
RefactoringVersion3 is looking at the Inappropriate Intimacy smell. I have included the test coverage in that file

I have provided notes files along with steps for removal for each bad smell identified.
Part A (smell identification) is found in Smell Detection.txt
Part B (test coverage) can be found in RefactoringVersion3
Part C (Refactoring) can be found in the folders named "RefactoringVersion"
The self-mark is in a word file named "Self-marking.docx"

Please note the smell detection is before the changes. The bad smells can be found in the original code.

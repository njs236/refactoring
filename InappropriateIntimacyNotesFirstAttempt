Successfully removed references to other classes from Controller and Command class.
Successfully put methods into appropriate classes. Added functions to RecordCollection, Record, and Controller class.
Problems encountered:
Deciding whether or not to put a reference to RecordCollection class in the serial_save function as it just dumps the whole class into pickle format.
Conscious that controller now has a bunch of methods responsible for the recordcollection. Does RecordCollection have all the functionality or does controller rely on logic
(meaning hard to replace with another class)?
It has turned the situation into a big dependent set of modules that work with each other, but rely too much on each other.

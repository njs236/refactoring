This is in keeping with the step in the code, to look at the next stage.

There are lots of references to controller within the command class, which are there only to make the program stop from breaking.

This means that I have just introduced complexity to the program by making a class that almost exclusively relies on another class for its implementation.

I will set up functions in the controller where applicable to reduce the dependency on the controller class, when I deal with the Inappropriate Intimacy smell.

However, the problem is solved. the controller class now only has 6 methods which interface with view in regard to displaying it to the user.
